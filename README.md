# DataStructures
Elementary Data Structures written Using C++ during the Summer of 2020 unless otherwise stated (either in the commit message or in a ReadMe file). Code was written just as I had finished self learning C++ and it obviously reflects in the quality (lol). Rather than using pre-established libraries like the C++ STL, I decided to write my own code to strengthen and further my understanding of the inner implementation of these complex data structures (their time complexities/space complexities, overall curiousity, etc). 

All data structure implementations except the Stack are templatized and allow for the storage of any standard, comparable data (e.x. char, string, double, int, etc).  

**FILES MAY CONTAIN SOME EXTRA ARBITRARY FUNCTIONS THAT WERE CHALLENGING/FUN AND RELATED TO THE DATA STRUCTURES (IGNORE THESE)**
